This is my first Semester Project at Noroff Front End Development. 

## Description

The assignment was to make a website for a community science museum that appeals to the target audience (children in school and families with young children). 

Considerations taken when making the website:

- Design that appeals to the target audience 
- Compositional principles, typography and color schemes. 
- Semantic HTML and CSS DRY 
- Photo size max 200kb for better performance
- Responsive across devices
- WCAG principles regarding hierarchy, navigation and color usage. 
- SEO (meta tags and alt text)

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Netlify

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
