This is my first Semester Project at Noroff Front End Development. 

## Description

The assignment was to make a website for a community science museum that appeals to the target audience (children in school and families with young children). 

Considerations taken when making the website:

- Design that appeals to the target audience 
- Compositional principles, typography and color schemes. 
- Semantic HTML and CSS DRY 
- Photo size max 200kb for better performance
- Responsive across devices
- WCAG principles regarding hierarchy, navigation and color usage. 
- SEO (meta tags and alt text)

## Built With

- Figma
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML 5
- CSS

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ellie489/SemesterProject1.git
